# Implementation of a Simple CNN on Public Datasets

This project demonstrates how to implement and train a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using publicly available datasets. It shows how to evaluate model performance using different metrics and visualize the results.

## ðŸ§  Key Features
- Load and preprocess image datasets
- Train a CNN from scratch
- Evaluate model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Visualize training curves

## ðŸ“š Software and Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **PyTorch** â€” for building and training the CNN model
- **torchvision** â€” for datasets and image transformations
- **NumPy** â€” for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â€” for visualization
- **scikit-learn** â€” for model evaluation metrics (e.g., classification report)


## ðŸ“ˆ Results
Achieved [insert accuracy]% accuracy on [dataset name].
